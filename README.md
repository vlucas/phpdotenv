PHP dotenv
==========

Loads environment variables from `.env` to `getenv()`, `$_ENV` and
`$_SERVER` automagically.

This is a PHP version of the original [Ruby
dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vlucas/phpdotenv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vlucas/phpdotenv)

Why .env?
---------
**You should never store sensitive credentials in your code**. Storing
[configuration in the environment](http://www.12factor.net/config) is one of
the tenets of a [twelve-factor app](http://www.12factor.net/). Anything that is
likely to change between deployment environments – such as database credentials
or credentials for 3rd party services – should be extracted from the
code into environment variables.

Basically, a `.env` file is an easy way to load custom configuration
variables that your application needs without having to modify .htaccess
files or Apache/nginx virtual hosts. This means you won't have to edit
any files outside the project, and all the environment variables are
always set no matter how you run your project - Apache, Nginx, CLI, and
even PHP 5.4's built-in webserver. It's WAY easier than all the other
ways you know of to set environment variables, and you're going to love
it.

* NO editing virtual hosts in Apache or Nginx
* NO adding `php_value` flags to .htaccess files
* EASY portability and sharing of required ENV values
* COMPATIBLE with PHP's built-in web server and CLI runner


Installation with Composer
--------------------------

```shell
curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar require vlucas/phpdotenv
```

Usage
-----
The `.env` file is generally kept out of version control since it can contain
sensitive API keys and passwords. A separate `.env.example` file is created
with all the required environment variables defined except for the sensitive
ones, which are either user-supplied for their own development environments or
are communicated elsewhere to project collaborators. The project collaborators
then independently copy the `.env.example` file to a local `.env` and ensure
all the settings are correct for their local environment, filling in the secret
keys or providing their own values when necessary. In this usage, the `.env`
file should be added to the project's `.gitignore` file so that it will never
be committed by collaborators.  This usage ensures that no sensitive passwords
or API keys will ever be in the version control history so there is less risk
of a security breach, and production values will never have to be shared with
all project collaborators.

Add your application configuration to a `.env` file in the root of your
project. **Make sure the `.env` file is added to your `.gitignore` so it is not
checked-in the code**

```shell
S3_BUCKET="dotenv"
SECRET_KEY="souper_seekret_key"
```

Now create a file named `.env.example` and check this into the project. This
should have the ENV variables you need to have set, but the values should
either be blank or filled with dummy data. The idea is to let people know what
variables are required, but not give them the sensitive production values.

```shell
S3_BUCKET="devbucket"
SECRET_KEY="abc123"
```

You can then load `.env` in your application with:

```php
$dotenv = new Dotenv\Dotenv(__DIR__);
$dotenv->load();
```

Optionally you can pass in a filename as the second parameter, if you would like to use something other than `.env`

```php
$dotenv = new Dotenv\Dotenv(__DIR__, 'myconfig');
$dotenv->load();
```

All of the defined variables are now accessible with the `getenv`
method, and are available in the `$_ENV` and `$_SERVER` super-globals.

```php
$s3_bucket = getenv('S3_BUCKET');
$s3_bucket = $_ENV['S3_BUCKET'];
$s3_bucket = $_SERVER['S3_BUCKET'];
```

You should also be able to access them using your framework's Request
class (if you are using a framework).

```php
$s3_bucket = $request->env('S3_BUCKET');
$s3_bucket = $request->getEnv('S3_BUCKET');
$s3_bucket = $request->server->get('S3_BUCKET');
$s3_bucket = env('S3_BUCKET');
```

### Nesting Variables

It's possible to nest an environment variable within another, useful to cut
down on repetition.

This is done by wrapping an existing environment variable in `${…}` e.g.

```shell
BASE_DIR="/var/webroot/project-root"
CACHE_DIR="${BASE_DIR}/cache"
TMP_DIR="${BASE_DIR}/tmp"
```

### Immutability

By default, Dotenv will NOT overwrite existing environment variables that are
already set in the environment.

If you want Dotenv to overwrite existing environment variables, use `overload`
instead of `load`:

```php
$dotenv = new Dotenv\Dotenv(__DIR__);
$dotenv->overload();
```

Requiring Variables to be Set
-----------------------------

Using Dotenv, you can require specific ENV vars to be defined, and throw
an Exception if they are not. This is particularly useful to let people know
any explicit required variables that your app will not work without.

You can use a single string:

```php
$dotenv->required('DATABASE_DSN');
```

Or an array of strings:

```php
$dotenv->required(['DB_HOST', 'DB_NAME', 'DB_USER', 'DB_PASS']);
```

If any ENV vars are missing, Dotenv will throw a `RuntimeException` like this:

```
One or more environment variables failed assertions: DATABASE_DSN is missing
```

### Empty Variables

Beyond simply requiring a variable to be set, you might also need to ensure the
variable is not empty:

```php
$dotenv->required('DATABASE_DSN')->notEmpty();
```

If the environment variable is empty, you'd get an Exception:

```
One or more environment variables failed assertions: DATABASE_DSN is empty
```

### Integer Variables

You might also need to ensure the the variable is of an integer value. You may do the following:

```php
$dotenv->required('FOO')->isInteger();
```

If the environment variable is not an integer, you'd get an Exception:

```
One or more environment variables failed assertions: FOO is not an integer
```

### Allowed Values

It is also possible to define a set of values that your environment variable
should be. This is especially useful in situations where only a handful of
options or drivers are actually supported by your code:

```php
$dotenv->required('SESSION_STORE')->allowedValues(['Filesystem', 'Memcached']);
```

If the environment variable wasn't in this list of allowed values, you'd get a
similar Exception:

```
One or more environment variables failed assertions: SESSION_STORE is not an
allowed value
```

### Comments

You can comment your `.env` file using the `#` character. E.g.

```shell
# this is a comment
VAR="value" # comment
VAR=value # comment
```

### Docker secrets

Docker allows sensitive information such as passwords or API keys to be declared as `secrets` in a container, in order to avoid having them stored in an image, having to mount them as volumes, or otherwise declare them as clear-text environment variables. The value of such secrets is stored as the contents of a file named after the secret name and stored under `/run/secrets`. For example, a MySQL password could be defined as the secret named `mysql_password` and its value would be stored in `/run/secrets/mysql_password`. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/.

It seems to be a Docker convention to declare the secret name as the value of an environment variable named after the originally desired environment variable with the suffix '_FILE' added. For example, the mysql image, which normally supports the environment variable `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, also supports the environment variable `MYSQL_PASSWORD_FILE`. If `MYSQL_PASSWORD_FILE` is declared, its value is assumed to be the secret name. The image will read the secret value from the secret file, and assign it as the value of the `MYSQL_PASSWORD` environment variable. In other words, the option `-e MYSQL_PASSWORD_FILE=mysql_password` will result in `MYSQL_PASSWORD` being defined with a value equal to the `mysql_password` secret, which is equal to the contents of the file `/run/secrets/mysql_password`.

An equivalent convention is now supported by PHP dotenv. If you include in your .env file a line like this:

```shell
VAR_FILE=/path/to/secret
```
and `path/to/secret` points to an existing and readable file, an environment variable named `VAR` will be created, and its value will be set to the contents of the file at the path indicated.

If the file does not exist or is unreadable, the `VAR_FILE` environment variable is treated normally, ie a `VAR_FILE` environment variable is created with the value `/path/to/secret`.

In production, on a real docker container, you should use the actual path, ie `/run/secrets/my_secret`. The `/run/secrets/` path is not hard-coded to allow for changes to the Docker implementation (all too frequent, unfortunately), and to support testing with arbitrary locations. Relative locations are computed relative to the `.env` file that defines the environment variable.

The path should not be quoted.

Please note that this does not actually create the docker secret. You still need to use the appropriate docker command to create the secret (`docker secret create` at the time of this writing). Declaring the environment variable with a `_FILE` suffix via PHP dotenv allows you to load an existing secret value as an environment variable without having to disclose the value in clear text.


Usage Notes
-----------

When a new developer clones your codebase, they will have an additional
**one-time step** to manually copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill-in
their own values (or get any sensitive values from a project co-worker).

phpdotenv is made for development environments, and generally should not be
used in production. In production, the actual environment variables should be
set so that there is no overhead of loading the `.env` file on each request.
This can be achieved via an automated deployment process with tools like
Vagrant, chef, or Puppet, or can be set manually with cloud hosts like
Pagodabox and Heroku.

### Command Line Scripts

If you need to use environment variables that you have set in your `.env` file
in a command line script that doesn't use the Dotenv library, you can `source`
it into your local shell session:

```
source .env
```
